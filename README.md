dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles, now managed with dotter.

They are visually based on [Hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots) using the Catppuccin-Mocha theme, but customized for my setup.
Even though I use dotter, I haven't set up templating for everything so if you wish to use these dotfiles, you'll probably have to change some things.
